# mini-projects
A set of small projects which I have done during experimenting with Python. Every project is detailed with comments.

Each projet is explained with comments. So, you can have nice understanding while going through each one of them. 

You can fork or clone and improve the projects. I have mentioned future options which can be done. I hope these can help you to get an idea and apply in real- time applications.

Note : These are short scripts written in Python.
